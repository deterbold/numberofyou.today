# number-of-you

## Background

This is the source code for the [Ridiculous Software](https://ridiculous.software) project [Number of You: Today](https://numberofyou.today).

The code was written using GitHub CoPilot and ChatGPT 3.5, with some minor contributions by a human. All mistakes were made by the flesh.

I would add a TODO list, but that would be a lot.
